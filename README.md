  <summary>Plan 1: Introduction</summary>

  **ORBITAL_COMMS** transforms satellite data into clear, actionable information to support disaster prevention.  
  When phenomena such as El Ni√±o alter climate patterns, they also impact the lives of thousands of families. This project enables monitoring of safe zones and informed decision-making based on reliable data.

  ### Objectives
  - Analyze satellite data in real time.
  - Visualize areas of risk and safety.
  - Facilitate preventive actions based on evidence.

  ### Technologies
  - Python, Flask (Backend)
  - JavaScript, HTML, CSS (Frontend)
  - NASA APIs (POWER & EONET)
