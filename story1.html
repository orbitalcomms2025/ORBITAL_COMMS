    <p>
      At the end of March 2017, the region of Piura awoke to chaos. 
      The Piura River, swollen by relentless rains caused by the 
      <b>Coastal El Niño Phenomenon</b>, overflowed and flooded entire districts.
    </p>

    <p class="highlight">
      “At 7 a.m., the river overflowed. Streets, houses, schools… everything was underwater.”
    </p>

    <p>
      SENAMHI authorities reported that the river’s flow reached 
      <b>3,100 m³/s</b>, far beyond safe limits. 
      The waters invaded the heart of the city, crossing the Main Square, 
      areas near Cáceres Bridge, and spreading into surrounding districts.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>More than <b>20,000 people</b> affected in Piura.</li>
      <li><b>2,401 homes</b> collapsed or were destroyed.</li>
      <li><b>8 deaths</b> and 11 injured.</li>
      <li>Over <b>240 schools</b> and 116 health centers affected.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In sectors such as La Arena, La Unión, Catacaos, and Cura Mori, the flooding was 
      devastating: entire neighborhoods were submerged, with no escape routes or safe zones.
    </p>

    <h2>Response and Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      Authorities urged residents to evacuate to higher floors or safe areas. 
      Rescue boats and trucks moved through the city while volunteers and NGOs 
      distributed water, food, and medicine. 
      However, for many, help came too late. 
      The disaster also exposed the fragility of local infrastructure: 
      collapsed drainage systems, broken retaining walls, and outdated defenses that couldn’t withstand the pressure.
    </p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
      1. Rivers must be regularly monitored and dredged.<br>
      2. Construction should never occur in high-risk zones.<br>
      3. Early warning systems are key to saving lives.<br>
      4. Reconstruction should be resilient, not just restorative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 2017 flood remains a painful memory, but also a wake-up call. 
      Every year, Piura’s survivors demand stronger infrastructure, 
      responsible urban planning, and respect for the river that gives life… but can also take it away.
