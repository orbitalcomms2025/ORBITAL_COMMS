<!-- STORY CONTENT -->
<section class="story-content story-block">
  <p>
    After the floods in March 2017, around <b>2,000 families</b> in Piura had to leave their homes. 
    Many moved to desert areas near the Piura–Chiclayo road, building improvised shelters 
    with limited materials and without basic services such as water, electricity, or sanitation.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “The heat and lack of infrastructure made every day a challenge to survive.”
  </p>

  <h2>Living Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improvised shelters made of wood, plastic, and cardboard.</li>
    <li>Limited access to drinking water and food.</li>
    <li>Scarce medical and educational assistance.</li>
    <li>Entire families sharing very small spaces.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Resilience and Organization</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the difficulties, the displaced communities organized to share food, 
    build improvised paths, and protect children and the elderly. 
    Solidarity among neighbors was key to surviving for weeks until receiving help from authorities and volunteers.
