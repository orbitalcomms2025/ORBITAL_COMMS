<!-- STORY CONTENT -->
<section class="story-content story-block">
  <p>
    In 2017, following the floods caused by the Coastal Niño, nearly <b>300,000 people</b> in northern Peru were displaced. 
    Entire families lost their homes and farmland, having to leave agriculture behind and move to temporary areas without basic services.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “We had to leave our land and adapt to living in improvised shelters, without water or electricity,” recounted an affected farmer.
  </p>

  <h2>Living Conditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improvised shelters made of wood, plastic, and cardboard.</li>
    <li>Limited access to drinking water, food, and medical care.</li>
    <li>Families living in cramped and precarious spaces.</li>
    <li>Total interruption of agricultural activities and loss of income.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Resilience and Solidarity</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the difficulties, many communities organized to share resources, build improvised paths, and protect children and the elderly. 
    Solidarity among neighbors was key to surviving until help arrived from authorities and volunteers.
