<!-- STORY CONTENT -->
<section class="story-content story-block">
  <p>
    During the March 2017 floods in Piura, thousands of volunteers mobilized to assist the affected families. 
    Local authorities coordinated emergency response teams, and NGOs provided food, water, and medical aid to displaced communities.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “Every hand counted. In the midst of disaster, the community came together to save lives.”
  </p>

  <h2>Relief Efforts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Distribution of clean water and non-perishable food supplies.</li>
    <li>Medical teams providing first aid and basic healthcare.</li>
    <li>Temporary shelters set up for families with nowhere to stay.</li>
    <li>Coordination between government, NGOs, and local volunteers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    Despite the rapid response, access to certain flooded areas was difficult due to damaged roads and collapsed bridges. 
    Volunteers had to navigate unsafe conditions to reach the most affected neighborhoods, highlighting the importance of disaster preparedness.
