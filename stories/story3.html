<!-- STORY CONTENT -->
<section class="story-content story-block">
  <p>
    During the <b>1997–1998 El Niño Phenomenon</b>, heavy rains and the increase in the Piura River’s flow caused the collapse of key bridges in the city, 
    including the <b>Bolognesi Bridge</b> and the <b>San Miguel Bridge</b>. This event isolated much of the city and left hundreds of people trapped in their neighborhoods.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “The river swept everything in its path; seeing the bridges give way to the force of the water was terrifying for residents.”
  </p>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hundreds of people were trapped in areas like La Arena and Catacaos.</li>
    <li>Vehicles and houses near the bridges suffered serious damage.</li>
    <li>Several injuries and deaths were reported due to the collapse and flooding.</li>
    <li>City transportation and logistics were paralyzed for several days.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Response and Reconstruction</h2>
  <p>
    Local authorities worked to set up temporary crossings and bring humanitarian aid to the isolated neighborhoods. 
    Later, the bridges were rebuilt with stronger standards, learning from the infrastructure weaknesses exposed by the tragedy.
  </p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
    1. Urban planning must consider extreme natural events.<br>
    2. Critical infrastructure requires resilient hydraulic and seismic design.<br>
    3. Coordination between authorities and communities is key for evacuation and rescue.<br>
    4. Monitoring rivers and drainage systems prevents similar disasters.
