<section class="story-content story-block">
  <p>
    During the March 2017 floods, Piura suffered one of the worst agricultural crises in its recent history. 
    Rice, corn, and banana fields were completely submerged, destroying the livelihoods of thousands of small farmers.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “What we planted with so much effort disappeared under the water. Now we have neither food nor money to survive,” said one affected farmer.
  </p>

  <h2>Consequences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>More than <b>5,000 hectares</b> of crops lost.</li>
    <li>Thousands of families left without income or food security.</li>
    <li>Severe economic impact on the region, with losses estimated in millions of soles.</li>
    <li>Food shortages and rising local prices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Relief and Assistance</h2>
  <p>
    Local organizations and NGOs distributed seeds, food, and tools to help farmers recover. 
    However, the scale of destruction made immediate field restoration difficult.
  </p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
    1. Agriculture requires proper prevention and drainage systems.<br>
    2. It is vital to have crop insurance and prompt government aid.<br>
    3. Community resilience is key to overcoming natural disasters.
