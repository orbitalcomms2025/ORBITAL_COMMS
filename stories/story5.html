  <p>
    During the Coastal Niño emergency in March 2017, local communities in Piura showed remarkable organizational capacity. 
    Volunteers improvised rescue boats, built safe paths, and distributed food, water, and medicine to isolated families.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    “If we hadn’t helped each other, many of us wouldn’t have survived,” recounted a volunteer neighbor.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Actions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Creation of improvised routes to access flooded areas.</li>
    <li>Use of boats and vehicles to rescue trapped families.</li>
    <li>Distribution of food, drinking water, and medicine to isolated communities.</li>
    <li>Organization of temporary shelters for affected families.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The local initiative allowed hundreds of families to receive immediate aid before authorities could provide official support. 
    Solidarity and cooperation were fundamental in reducing the disaster’s impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
  <p>
    1. Community organization can save lives during emergencies.<br>
    2. Local training and preparedness are key to rapid response.<br>
    3. Solidarity strengthens resilience against natural disasters.
